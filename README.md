####What is MusicShare? Well, it is a neat Python (3.X) script that works with a text service (Twilio) to will allow anyone in any location to search/play/skip and much more via SMS to any Bose speaker with SoundTouchâ„¢. Currently works with [Deezer](http://www.deezer.com/) and [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/us/).

####Any commits, input, and/or issue reports are *welcome*! We want to make MusicShare the best it can be!
